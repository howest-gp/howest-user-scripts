# Howest Prog Classroom Conventions

A user script to validate Howest PROG conventions in GitHub Classrooms

## What it does

When creating or editing a Classroom or Assignment in [GitHub Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms), this user script will assist you in validating the names according to the [conventions for Howest PROG](https://studenthowest.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/staff/PROG/Curriculummateriaal/201920/00%20-%20GP%20-%20Graduaat%20Programmeren/GitHub%20Classroom%20-%20Handleiding.pdf?csf=1&e=9B3Vyf).

Given an invalid name or prefix, you will see a suggestion on how to correct the error. The submit button will be disabled until you correct it.
