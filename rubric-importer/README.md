# Howest Prog Rubric Importer

A user script to import a rubric in raw JSON data, generated by a rubric template.

## What it does

Rubrics are hard to maintain or duplicate in canvas. It's common to create rubrics in external tools before tediously copying them in to the Canvas UI.
This script the generated JSON from the [Rubrics Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/howest-gp/howest-user-scripts/master/rubric-importer/rubric-template.xlsm) to bypass the Canvas UI and force the creation of predefined Rubrics.

The user script adds a button in the Rubrics pages of Canvas. This opens the import dialog.
